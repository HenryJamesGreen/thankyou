# Thank you app

Deployed app:

https://thankyou-very-much.netlify.app/

## Description 

This is a react single-page app we built to say thank you to our instructors.


## Installation and Usage

This beautiful and emotionally devastating thank-you page can be loaded in any browser in a computer and probably a tablet, but is not mobile responsive because we are very tired from finishing the course, and thinking the words 'media queries' makes my tummy hurt.

The page consists of a really gorgeous home page, and page full of heart-warming gratitude ('Thankyou'). On the thank you page are a series of accordion components, each with a thank-you message that will make the reader piss tears. There is a nav bar if you fancy jumping between the two. There is also a footer with build credit and a link to this very repo (you're here because you found that already, aren't you?)


## Development

This app was built on little to no sleep. The technologies used include computers, mice and keyboards. 
Along with React, this app was built with MUI components, Spotify embedding, CSS, some advice from ChatGPT, React Router Dom and some noises Henry made.
