Nirmeet, Chelsea, John, Chadrick, Laura, Lee and all the other team, I think I speak for everyone when I say a huge THANK YOU for being so kind, considerate and helpful. You've taken a technological idiot and turned into a slightly less technological idiot, and for that I will be eternally grateful! Wishing you all the best of luck in whatever you do."
