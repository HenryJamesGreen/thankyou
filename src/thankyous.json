Nirmeet, Chelsea, John, Chadrick, Laura, Lee and all the other team, I think I speak for everyone when I say a huge THANK YOU for being so kind, considerate and helpful. You've taken a technological idiot and turned into a slightly less technological idiot, and for that I will be eternally grateful! Wishing you all the best of luck in whatever you do.",

Thank you for your graceful and humorous teaching style. Because of you, I will always think of ‘playing catch’ by myself when I return a function without a variable. Or my partner coming into the work place and calling me by pet name, when I try to call a variable outside of its scope. Your metaphors were so imaginative and kept me engaged, I just wish I wrote them all down now. I can't thank you enough for guiding us through this journey. ☀️ Chad! Your kindness, time and dedication know no bounds. Thank you so much for taking the time to understand the problems I was having, even when I wasn't clear on them myself. Your patience and commitment as a mentor is priceless and I feel extremely lucky to have been in your team. Thank you for everything 🙏"
