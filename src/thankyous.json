You've taken a technological idiot and turned into a slightly less technological idiot, and for that I will be eternally grateful! Wishing you all the best of luck in whatever you do.",

Your metaphors were so imaginative and kept me engaged, I just wish I wrote them all down now. I can't thank you enough for guiding us through this journey. ‚òÄÔ∏è Chad! Your kindness, time and dedication know no bounds. Thank you so much for taking the time to understand the problems I was having, even when I wasn't clear on them myself.
